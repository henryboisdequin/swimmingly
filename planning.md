An app which a swimmer/coach can put their workouts on. This is like a database filled of your swim workouts. The swimmer/coach can put the splits of the swimmer on each set. The coach/swimmer will add the distance of the practice, the intensity, the time it took, and add notes on which part was hard, easy, etc. This way the coach/swimmer can track their workouts and how to improve the swimmers/you're performance in the pool.
